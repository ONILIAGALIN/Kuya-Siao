        <h2>Elon Musk</h2>
        <p>Billionaire Elon Musk has officially launched his own AI company, xAI with a stated goal <br> to “understand the true nature of the universe”.
            The xAI website is sparse on details about <br> how exactly Musk’s new company will achieve its lofty aims, but it does name the full <br> 12-person team – which appears to be all-male – and features people who have worked <br> with the likes of OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft on their AI programs. <br>
            In a Twitter Spaces chat on Thursday, Musk repeated his science fiction informed belief <br> that an artificial superintelligence could destroy humanity, adding that xAI would try to <br> “grow” a “maximally curious AI”. He described this sort of AI as “one that is trying to <br> understand the universe” which Musk said would be “pro-humanity” because of the simple <br> claim that this non-existent artificial mind would view humanity as “much more interesting <br> than not-humanity”.
            The company website explicitly states that xAI is separate to <br> Musk’s X Corp “but will work closely with X (Twitter), Tesla, and other companies”.
